The Linear algebra module is a collection of various decomposition and factorization algorithms
used to solve for overdetermined homogeneous linear system

# Steps to Compute the Least Squares 

Step 1 : Run the create linear system to initialize the Matrix A and precompute the decomposition Matrix

-- run $create_linear_system.py

Step 2 : Solve the Least Squares for X using decomposition methods and get Least Squares Norm

-- run $solve_least_squares.py
